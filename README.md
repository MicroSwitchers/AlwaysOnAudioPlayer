### CD Player (Linux Only)
- Detect and play audio CDs
- Track listing and playback
- CD eject functionality
- Support for cdparanoia for audio extraction
- Configurable CD drive path

### Player Features
- Full playback controls (play, pause, skip, seek)
- Shuffle and repeat modes
- Volume control
- Now playing bar with track info
- Full-screen player interface
- Progress tracking

## Requirements

### For All Platforms
- Flutter SDK (3.0.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.0.0 or higher)

### For Linux CD Playback
- Linux operating system
- CD-ROM drive
- `cdparanoia` (optional, for better CD support)

## Installation

### 1. Clone or Download the Project

```bash
cd "d:\My Code\DartFlutter\DF Media Interface RPI"
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Install Linux Tools (For CD Playback)

On Raspberry Pi or Linux:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cdparanoia
```

## Running the Application

### On Linux (Native)

```bash
flutter run -d linux
```

### On Web

```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

Or build for web deployment:

```bash
flutter build web
```

The built files will be in `build/web/` directory.

### On Raspberry Pi

For optimal performance on Raspberry Pi:

```bash
# Enable Linux desktop support if not already enabled
flutter config --enable-linux-desktop

# Run the app
flutter run -d linux --release
```

## Configuration

### CD Drive Path

By default, the CD drive is set to `/dev/cdrom`. You can change this in the app:

1. Navigate to the CD Player tab
2. Tap the Settings icon
3. Enter your CD drive path (e.g., `/dev/sr0`, `/dev/cdrom1`)

### Music Directories

To add music directories:

1. Navigate to the Local Music tab
2. Tap the folder icon in the app bar
3. Select your music directory
4. The app will automatically scan for audio files

## Key Technologies

- **Flutter**: Cross-platform UI framework
- **just_audio**: Audio playback engine
- **provider**: State management
- **Radio Browser API**: Internet radio station database
- **shared_preferences**: Local data persistence

## Platform Support

| Feature | Web | Linux | Notes |
|---------|-----|-------|-------|
| Local Music | ✅ | ✅ | File picker works on both |
| Internet Radio | ✅ | ✅ | Fully supported |
| CD Playback | ❌ | ✅ | Linux only |
| File System Access | Limited | ✅ | Web has browser restrictions |

## Troubleshooting

### CD Not Detected

1. Ensure you're running on Linux
2. Check that `cdparanoia` is installed: `which cdparanoia`
3. Verify CD drive path in settings
4. Check drive permissions: `ls -l /dev/cdrom`
5. Try mounting manually: `sudo mount /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom`

### Audio Not Playing

1. Check system audio settings
2. Verify audio files are in supported formats
3. For radio: Check internet connection
4. Check app volume settings

### Performance Issues on Raspberry Pi

1. Use release mode: `flutter run --release`
2. Close background applications
3. Consider using a lighter desktop environment
4. Reduce UI animations if needed

## Development

### Adding New Features

The app uses Provider for state management. To add new features:

1. Create/modify models in `lib/models/`
2. Implement business logic in `lib/services/`
3. Create UI in `lib/screens/` or `lib/widgets/`
4. Register providers in `main.dart`

### Building for Production

**Linux:**
```bash
flutter build linux --release
```

**Web:**
```bash
flutter build web --release
```
